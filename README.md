# `react-chartjs-2` adapter overwriting issue repro

> âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

This repo is a reproduction of an issue that does not allow usage of `chartjs-adapter-date-fns` and likely other date adapters with `react-chartjs-2`.

These adapters affect the `chart.js` library by calling `_adapters._date.override()`, which modifies the prototype of a default internal stub adapter that throws on invocation of any of its methods.

Currently `react-chartjs-2` seems to ignore this override call when used.
